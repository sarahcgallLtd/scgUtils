## Overview
`scgUtils` is a comprehensive R package designed to streamline the process of survey data analysis and visualisation. 
It offers a range of functions for data processing, exploration, and stylish visualisations, adhering to branding 
guidelines with custom colour schemes and themes.

### Features

- **Survey Data Processing**: Simplify the manipulation of survey datasets with functions like [`get_data()`](https://sarahcgallLtd.github.io/scgUtils/reference/get_data.html) and [`process_factors()`](https://sarahcgallLtd.github.io/scgUtils/reference/process_factors.html).
- **Data Exploration Tools**: Dive into your data using functions such as [`crosstab()`](https://sarahcgallLtd.github.io/scgUtils/reference/crosstab.html) and [`grp_freq()`](https://sarahcgallLtd.github.io/scgUtils/reference/grp_freq.html) for detailed analyses.
- **Custom Visualisations**: Bring your data to life with various plotting functions, from [`plot_parliament()`](https://sarahcgallLtd.github.io/scgUtils/reference/plot_parliament.html) for election outcomes to [`plot_sankey()`](https://sarahcgallLtd.github.io/scgUtils/reference/plot_sankey.html) for flow data representation.
- **Styling and Brand Consistency**: Maintain brand integrity with [`colour_pal()`](https://sarahcgallLtd.github.io/scgUtils/reference/colour_pal.html) and [`theme_scg()`](https://sarahcgallLtd.github.io/scgUtils/reference/theme_scg.html), ensuring consistent and appealing data presentations.

### Installation

Install the development version of `scgUtils` directly from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("sarahcgallLtd/scgUtils")
```

## Usage
Here's a quick example of using `scgUtils` to analyse and visualise survey data:

```r
# Load sample data
df <- get_file("inst/extdata/survey.sav")

# Explore data with a crosstab
crosstab(data = df,
         rowVar = "p_eurefvote",
         colVar = "p_edlevel",
         weight = "wt",
         format = "df_wide",
         round_decimals = 2,
         statistics = TRUE,
         plot = TRUE
)
# [1] "p_eurefvote x p_edlevel: Chisq = 371.026 | DF = 10 | Cramer's V = 0.243 | p-value = 0"
#         p_eurefvote Undergraduate A-level Below GCSE  GCSE No qualifications Postgrad Total
